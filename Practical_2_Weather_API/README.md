# Practical 2: Weather API CRUD Application

This project implements a RESTful interface that connects to two public APIs to demonstrate GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE functionality.

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a folder and inside it, create two files:
   - `index.html`
   - `script.js`

2. Replace `"YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"` in `script.js` with your actual key from:
   - https://openweathermap.org/

3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to run the app.

## API Usage

- **GET** – Fetch weather data from OpenWeatherMap API.
- **POST/PUT/DELETE** – Simulate location data CRUD using JSONPlaceholder API.

## Features

- Tabbed navigation for each HTTP method.
- Weather lookup by city name.
- Location CRUD operations.
- Editable modal and response displays.
